  * Finding the Goblet in the dining hall was pretty tough, but of course I look at everything. I wonder if I will use it later on.
  * This game strongly hints that the brother will be evil later on.
  * I like the ability to look at the score, but not have it forced on you if you do not want to look.
## Courtyard ##
  * Nice dialog with the shapeshifter.
  * "Jump Down Well" eh?. Interesting way to preview a future area.

## Tower ##
Interesting non-linear choice with the Duchess. I went with taking the amulet, but denying her services.
The rock climbing animation is great. They obviously take a lot of pride in that, as indicated by the 3 minute cutscene of him climbing.
Freaking girl came with... Then died. Maybe I could have done that better?

Of course, I walked around the tower and got grabbed by the Vines.
The combination of:
Blue
Back
Seedless Oranges
Got me killed.
I wonder if this is DRM protection?

Anyway, grabbed some feathers on the way down. Another hidden item. Can't help but notice that the girl or beat is no longer there.

Thinking about Directions:
SOPTUS and TRATRATRASHAB are places

To TRATRATRASHAB:
FALLA
ECLIPTUS
ECLIPTUS
POPO FALLA

To SOPTUS :
SHAB
ECLIPTUS
SHAB
SHAB

Falla and Ecliptus cannot be opposite directions, neither can Shab and Ecliptus. The reasoning here is that he would then tell you to go north and then south, if that were the case.
I assume that neither place will take me east, as the trader knows I came from the east, and that's where the kingdom is.
Also the guy in town referred to Soptus Ecliptus shaman. It would make sense that Ecliptus meant west, because the desert is to the west.
Therefore:
Falla must be either North or South, with Shab being the other direction.
Ecliptus is west.

Trader -> North West West Popo North -> TRATRATRASHAB
This was it popo means twice north.
Trader -> South West West Popo South -> TRATRATRASHAB
Trader -> South West South South ->  SOPTUS
Trader -> North West North North->  SOPTUS
Not sure what Popo means.
