# Introduction #

After work one day, we were discussing what we really like or hate about adventure games.  It was pretty much just your average day for single adventure guys.  We think we might have managed to deconstruct the elements of adventure, though!


# The 3 Elements of Adventure #
An adventure is a construct of the mind. We believe that in any adventure, there are 3 questions that the player ponders, whether consciously or unconsciously:

  * What is it? (What am I after?)
  * Where is it? (Where can I find it?)
  * How is it used? (What do I want to do with it?)

We contest that a good or satisfying adventure is one where the player starts with only the bare minimum knowledge of the task at hand.  When too little information about the task is received, the player may miss the quest entirely, or their interest may not be sufficiently stimulated.  When too much information is received, however, the game is at risk of causing the player boredom.  Ideally, the player receives just enough information to pique the interest and start pondering the questions we describe above: the 3 elements of adventure!
