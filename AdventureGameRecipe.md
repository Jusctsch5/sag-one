# Adventure Game Checklist #

## Basic Design ##
  * How the game should present itself via plot, graphics, and sounds
  * AGI, SCI
  * SCUMM, AGS
  * Length
  * Saving
  * Death

## Plot ##
  * A series of related events which take place during the game
  * The plot not only includes the scope of the game itself, but also  events that happened prior that help set up the current plot
  * the plot could be linear or branching, maybe not have a true end

## Environment ##
  * More of a thought or idea than something tangible
  * Where this plot takes place
  * Why it has to happen here, why the environment is what it is
  * How the game should appear to the user i.e. dark, adventurous, silly, thoughtful

## Characters ##
  * List of characters that could have some role in the adventure
  * What the characters can contribute individually to advance the plot ( a character should not exist for his/her own sake)
  * Where/why do these characters live and how did they get in their current situation

## Puzzles ##
  * Puzzles should be designed to engage the user in the plot
  * No required fetch quests!

## Script ##
  * Dialog for characters
  * Narration for non-characters

## Programming ##
  * Putting everything together

## Sprites ##
  * Sprites are objects, characters, i.e., interactable things
  * A sprite may be required to move and change shape, regardless of the above type ( A rope must change shape when it is attached, a rope must move when thrown)
  * Sprites may also need to 'change shape' due to inventory possession

## Background ##
  * Needs to fit the Environment, to fit the Atmosphere
  * Take existing images/art and transpose it to fit the Atmosphere

## Sound Effects ##
  * Find existing sound effects, probably use sparingly

## Music ##
  * Compose something that already has a known purpose
  * Consider the length of time needed

## Voice Recordings ##
  * Reuse the most common events "I can't do this", "Hello there!"
  * Tone must match the situation
  * Voice can be altered for characters that need it
