# Introduction #

The purpose of this document is to try and explain what a puzzle in an adventure game is, what is its purpose, and what makes it effective.
After the summary, this document will break down different puzzles and explain them in relation to the above criteria. The fourth wall will likely be broken, as the author stands on his soap box and talks about what type of puzzles he likes, and if the examples are those types of puzzles or not.


# What is a Puzzle #

A puzzle is any series of actions to accomplish a goal, which requires some interaction by the user.

The general flow of the puzzle is the following:
**Puzzle is presented to the user**User thinks about a particular action for the puzzle
**User performs an action**The action's effect on the puzzle is checked, and the puzzle's state may change
**This effect may solve the puzzle, otherwise repeat the second step until the puzzle is solved**

(Note that a large puzzle may be perceived to have smaller puzzles built around them, this does not change the above flow)

The puzzle does require the user to think, but the puzzle does not complete until the action is made. No puzzle is truly solved until it is completed, after the user's action. In an adventure game, actions are generally performed by selecting/using various items, objects, or people in the game world.

A Puzzle shares some similarities with Tasks or Quests, and thus it could be reasonable to consider a Puzzle to be one or both. They are not mutually exclusive, and time should not be spent trying to determine whether a particular action is part of a Puzzle or Task. The best-practices in designing good puzzles is very similar with good quests, which is also similar to good game design or good design in general. That being said, the particulars of Tasks and Quests will not be talked about here, even if they may apply.

# What is the Purpose of a Puzzle #
Puzzles are in some ways no different than most tasks required in other games. A puzzle is a road-block, that must be solved by the player. This is a concept shared in many games. The road-blocks in other games, however, are generally bypassed through manual dexterity and timing (jumping over a rock, shooting a bad-guy, etc). In adventure games, puzzles are generally solved through more mental means. In non-adventure games, puzzles test your dexterity and quickness; in adventure games, they test your observation and thinking skills. Different puzzles require different skills, and challenge those skills at different levels.

# What Makes a Puzzle Effective #

As mentioned above, puzzles test different mental skills. Effective puzzles will fit the game's atmosphere, and test certain mental attributes which fit the level required of the player. An effective puzzle cannot be too difficult at the player, at the point in time it is required to be completed. For example, don't start off an adventure game with a confusing one-minute bomb-defusing exercise. Likewise, the last couple puzzles in a game shouldn't be cake - that's extremely off-putting.
