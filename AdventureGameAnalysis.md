# Raw Version #

## Point of no Return ##
  * most importantly, give the player the ability to escape the point of no return
  * the player should have the opportunity to be given fair warning; break the "fourth wall" if necessary (are you sure you want to do that? Are you REALLY sure?), but don't hold the player's hand
  * give the player time to prepare whenever possible

  * consider whether a point of no return is necessary; does it really add value (from the player's perspective?)
  * examples of fair warning for point of no return:
    * good example: QFG2 caravan to Raseir
    * poor example: QFG1 attacking the white stag
    * poor example: KQ2 EGA walking over the bridge by the door 4 times (you can't cross it 5 times, hence technically a point-of-no-return)

### Fair Warning of Point of no Return ###
  * examples of fair warning for point of no return:
    * good example: Glowing eyes for Ad Abus in the alley (you can run away from him). The beast can tip you off on this.
    * good example: QF2 it is known how many days in advance the caravan is - known by asking the guard
    * good example: KQ2 the 'door' clearly tells you that you are going to a far away place
    * bad example: a score close to the maximum is not a good warning

### Death ###
  * is a "point of no return"
  * it's a good idea to treat death sequences just like any point of no return; loading games without warning isn't "fun"
  * it should be known to the user that a death may be coming, the user must be given fair warning - even break the fourth wall
  * good example: The snake in Kings Quest 5, Cedwick warns that you'll likely die if you get closer
  * good example: Zombies in KQ6 will walk around the screen and kill you if they touch you (when in the underworld)
  * bad example:  The Boogieman in Kings Quest 7, randomly pops out and kills you
  * bad example: Approaching the Yeti in KQ5 without buying a pie


## Puzzles ##
"bad" puzzle case studies
  * Iced Lettuce (KQ6): unintuitive solution item, item difficult to locate, item location not intuitive to context of the puzzle. Puns make for bad hints
  * Brauggi Bartyr (QFG1): arbitrary item count required

"good" puzzle case studies
  * Ad Avis moonlight riddles (QFG2): completely optional; satisfying if answered but no real penalty for missing
  * Underworld love riddle (KQ6): hints available ingame, but puzzle can be solved independently with some thought
  * Erasmus house trivia (QFG1): random questions, answers available ingame, pop culture references, minor penalty for failure

## Things that are awesome ##
  * Bargaining for elemental quest items (QFG2): get quest items for free if you tell about the situation
  * Catching the player off-guard by inducing neat quirks in the regular gameplay
    * example: mirror image fight, thief guy helps you(QFG3)
  * attention to detail (ex: KQ6 pawn shop): backstories and dialogue for random items with no relevance to the game's plot
  * fun" common characteristics of many classic adventure games
    * pop culture references and easter eggs
    * puns and "silly" humor, occasional lowbrow or "dirty" humor
    * breaking the fourth wall
    * generally family friendly (no blood or otherwise explicitly mature scenes)

other thoughts
  * no text-parser based games have voiced dialogue... that could be an interesting if ambitious feature

Given the below information,

## Quests in General ##
  * What is the Quest or Event - Known already on getting the quest
    1. What is it?
> > 2. Where is it?
> > 3. How is used?
The answer to all three of those questions should not be presented to the user on learning about the quest. The user should find the answers to these questions while on the quest.

## Example Quest ##
  * Baba Yaga is causing the curse, you must stop her. However, she is a great spellcaster, and she's pretty darn unbeatable.
  * Solving the Task:
    * What is it: The Mirror
    * Where is it: Passed from Eramus to Hermit to Jester,
    * How is it used: Reflect a spell
  * The game gives you the 'what' initially
  * The game changes the 'where' throughout the game
  * The 'how' isn't really defined, it's up to the player to figure it out, although it's pretty obvious
  * Personally, I think this is not an example of a good task.
  * How could this task be improved?
    * I feel like this quest is given to you far too early for how long it is
    * A long quest, as this one is, shouldn't be so well defined in the beginning of the game
    * It would have been better if the 'mirror' wasn't revealed until later in the game, and if more of the task was focused on finding out what Yaga's weakness
    * The better 'what' in this case would be something less obvious to the player than a mirror that reflects all spells
    * The where is fine.
    * The 'how' should be a little less obvious, see the following example...

## Better Example Quest ##
  * Manannan is mean. However, he is a great spellcaster, and he pretty darn unbeatable.
  * Solving the Task:
    * What is it: Cat transformation spell
    * Where is it: Found as a recipe in Manannan's secret room
    * How is it used: Cast on a cookie!
  * Reasons why this is awesome
    * You are never told directly to use it on Manannan.
    * The user has to rely on a 'hint' - that he needs to feed the wizard every so often
    * The act of him eating the cookie is very climactic, because it seems as though it may or may not work

Fetch Quests:
A task in which too much of the information provided below is given, or none of it is known. In that definition, a fetch quest is subjective. A fetch quest is often not important to the story of the game, by design, not intent.

Optional Fetch Quests:
We have less of a problem with these types of tasks. They should be optional, hence the name. Optional quests can be traps, wasted time from the main game. That can be both good and bad.
