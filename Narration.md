# Introduction #
In order for the player to solve the various puzzles that emerge throughout the course of an adventure, it is necessary for the game to present relevant information.  Narration refers to the words and text by which an adventure game communicates information to the player.  A narrator is an object that supplies narration.

# Attributes #
(Where is it?)
**Internal**: has a presence within the game world.
**External**: exists outside of the game world.

(What is it?)
**Noncorporeal**: an object that isn't directly addressable.
**Corporeal**: an object that is directly addressible.

(How is it used?)
**Direct**: responds to requests from the player.
**Indirect**: does not use requests from the player.

# Examples #
  * Merlin (Conquests of Camelot): always Internal, usually Corporeal, always Direct (Noncorporeal: Merlin's room in the castle)
  * Goat (KQ1): always Internal, always Corporeal, usually Indirect (Direct: carrot)
  * "Narrator" (KQ6, QFG4): always External, always Noncorporeal, usually Direct (Indirect: labyrinth hole in the wall)
  * Tomato (KQ6): always Internal, always Corporeal, usually Direct

# Narration Space #
There is a limited space available for narration.  For instance, it would be very difficult to assign the same object Internal and External narration attributes within a single game.  Similarly, it may be counterintuitive to employ an Internal Corporeal Direct narrator in addition to an External Noncorporeal Direct narrator.

We think it's wise to restrict the number of narrators present in the same space.  (For instance, never have 5 tomatoes.)
