# Introduction #

To learn about AGS and our other development tools, we will first develop a "sandbox" project as a learning exercise.
  * This may or may not ultimately yield a fully playable game.
  * This project should never distract from our main project; the focus should always be on learning about some aspect of development.

# Interface #
This game will use a point and click "word-click" interface.
  * There will be only two words available: "look at," and "punch."
  * "Walk to" is right-click.
  * The game will use a string builder, like any word-click adventure.

# Narration #
The game will be narrated primarily by the Internal Corporeal Indirect narration style, conveyed by the protagonist.

# Concept #
The protagonist is one who believes that all problems can be solved with a solid punch to the face.
