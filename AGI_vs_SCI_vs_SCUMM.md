# AGI vs SCI vs SCUMM #
...or more appropriately, text-parser interface vs point-and-click vs word-click.

## Introduction ##
The interface is the player's sole means of interacting with and affecting the game environment.  As such, it warrants a particularly thorough consideration.  Various styles of user interfaces have been implemented throughout the history of adventure gaming; for the purpose of this paper, we shall limit our scope to the three most successful interface types.  These include the text-parser interface, as observed in Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI); the point-and-click interface, as seen in Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) games; and the here-labeled "word-click" interface, as seen in the Lucas Arts SCUMM games.

## Text Parser (AGI) ##
The text parser interface has perhaps the greatest potential for immersion of all defined interface options; the user can type whatever they like into the parser and is bound only by the limits of their own imagination and language. With a well-defined parser, the game can appear to be quite "smart" and an illusion of great depth is established.

Text parser interfaces naturally cause a game to become more "puzzle-like" and mysterious because the player must carefully read the dialog windows, remember key bits of information, and produce the appropriate information in a given scenario from his or her own memory.

Text parser interfaces consume very little or no screen real estate.  The text parser appears when a player presses any alphanumeric key; the parser is otherwise hidden. Traditionally, the game will pause while the text parser is active in order to allow the player to finish typing.

A notable advantage of the text parser interface is that it requires the least number of input devices, using only a keyboard.  The simplicity of this interface combined with its appearance of depth makes it a very competitive option, even today.

## Point-and-Click (SCI) ##
The standard point and click interface consists of some small set of action icons coupled with an inventory.  The game can usually be played exclusively with a mouse, although a keyboard is usually used for naming save files.

Point and click is a very popular interface, likely due to its ease of use. Dialog with characters is reduced to a set of clickable keywords, so the player doesn't really need to remember any information.

The point and click interface actions and inventory are usually hidden at the top of the screen, and will appear when the mouse hovers there.  The amount of screen real estate consumed by the interface is negligible.

The most notable advantage of the point and click interface is probably its ease of use as mentioned previously.  It's a universally approachable interface, in the sense that it employs semiotics which can be understood by anyone regardless of their spoken language(s).  Coupled with voiced narration, a point and click game can be played without any reading or typing on the part of the player.

## Word-Click (SCUMM) ##
The word click interface employed by SCUMM games combines qualities of the text parser and the point and click interface.  The player uses the mouse exclusively to interact with the world, but rather than clicking on icons, the player clicks on words such as "Talk to" or "Look at".  The player then subsequently clicks on an object on the screen which they wish to perform the action on, e.g. "Look at (apple)"

Word-click interfaces traditionally consume a large portion of the screen in a static fashion, much larger than the other two popular interfaces.

The word-click interface was used effectively by many successful games.  It's not so simple or as universal as the point and click interface, nor does it leave as much open to the player's imagination as the text parser interface.  It's an approach which perhaps takes the "middle ground" between the two other popular interfaces.

## Conclusion ##
All three interfaces have their strengths and weaknesses.  A pure point and click or text parser interface is perhaps best due to their significantly smaller footprint on the screen compared with word-click interfaces. However, the word-click interface was employed by many games which are still popular today such as Monkey Island.

For maximum engagement of the player with reading, writing, and memory exercises, the text-parser approach is recommended.

For maximum approachability and ease of use, a standard point and click interface is recommended.
